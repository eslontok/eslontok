- 👋 Hi, I’m Earl Lontok. I recently graduated from the Honors College at Rutgers University - New Brunswick with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Biology. I am well-versed in the Java, Python, JavaScript, and C programming languages and have engaged in several individual and collaborative projects involving data structures. I seek not just innovative solutions but also ways to optimize existing ones. My experiences as a student have refined my ability to communicate, lead, and adapt in a dynamic environment. My desire to learn is never-ending, and I am always searching for opportunities that advance my skillset whilst being open to learning new ones.
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of technology and human physiology. I hope to someday work on projects that aim to integrate technology and healthcare to benefit the lives of all people. "Health is wealth", and with the world's increasing reliance on technology, I believe we can use our skills to ensure that healthiness is something we can all achieve.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Outside, I enjoy doing parkour 🏃 and going on hikes ⛰️. Indoors, I enjoy playing video games 🎮 and folding origami 🐦.
